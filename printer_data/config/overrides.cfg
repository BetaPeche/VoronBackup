############################################# \
######## USER CONFIG OVERRIDES FILE #########  + --> This will help you personalize my config to your printer :)
############################################# /

# This file is yours! Feel free to edit it in order to include all the needed
# things to adapt my generic config to your machine. This file will not be erased
# when updating the config using moonraker and it will be kept as you've set it.
# You can change every section of the config. You can also add some new custom macros, etc...
# The corresponding documentation can be found in: docs > overrides.md

### Also, keep in mind: if you use a multi-MCU config such as the old school double SKRs or a CANbus toolhead
### board, you will need to specify which components are connected to which board in your own mcu.cfg file!
### Example: if something is connected to the toolhead MCU, you should use "config_pin: toolhead:PIN_NAME".

#> Main control MCUs are called "mcu" (and "secondary" when using a double MCU configuration)
#> Toolhead CANboard MCUs are called "toolhead"
#> ERCF MCUs are called "ercf"

#   START_PRINT SEQUENCE  #
#-------------------------#

## The START_PRINT sequence is modular and fully customizable. A default START_PRINT sequence is auto-populated based on
## your probe choice (TAP, Dockable, Inductive), but if for some reasons you still want to modify it, please uncomment the following 3
## lines to define a new `variable_startprint_actions`. You can use any number of action or even duplicate some actions if needed.
## Available actions: "bed_soak", "extruder_preheating", "chamber_soak", "extruder_heating", "tilt_calib", "z_offset", "bedmesh", "purge", "clean", "primeline"
##
# [gcode_macro _USER_VARIABLES]
# variable_startprint_actions: "action1", "action2", ...
# gcode: # do not remove this line

#   EXTRUDER/BED PIDs     #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for the PIDs. I put them here as almost everyone will use them,
## so just uncomment the following lines and change the values according to your own machine
[extruder]
control: pid
pid_kp: 37.694
pid_ki: 14.782
pid_kd: 24.030

[heater_bed]
control: pid
pid_kp: 57.789
pid_ki: 3.669
pid_kd: 227.543


#-------------------------#
#   Z MOTORS DIRECTION    #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for the motor directions as it's a pretty common one. If you need
## to invert the Z1 or Z3 motor direction on your machine, just uncomment the following lines.
[stepper_z1]
dir_pin: !Z1_DIR

[stepper_z3]
dir_pin: !Z3_DIR

[extruder]
dir_pin: !E_DIR


#-------------------------#
#   FAN    #
#-------------------------#


[temperature_fan rpi_fan]
max_speed: 0.50


#-------------------------#
#   Probe Offsets         #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for bed probes. These frequently have calibrated offsets for xyz,
## and many will need them during setup. If you need to set these, just uncomment the following lines.
# [probe]
# x_offset: -1.85
# y_offset: 29.3
# z_offset: 5.180

[stepper_z]
position_endstopÂ : 0.360

pin: STATUS_NEOPIXEL
#   The pin connected to the neopixel. This parameter must be provided.

#   provided pin. The default is 1 (which indicates only a single
#   Neopixel is connected to the pin).
color_order: GRB, GRB, GRB, GRB, GRB, GRB, GRB, GRB, GRBW,  GRBW
#   Set the pixel order required by the LED hardware. Options are GRB,

initial_RED: 1.0
initial_GREEN: 0.0
initial_BLUE: 1.0
initial_WHITE: 0.0
#   Sets the initial LED color of the Neopixel. Each value should be
